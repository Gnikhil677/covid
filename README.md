# 🌐 COVID 19 - Pandemic Trends Power BI Dashboard

![Untitled video - Made with Clipchamp (1)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32a0068a-36a9-4e7c-939f-ff67cd8dca83)

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of global COVID-19 trends and impacts. The dashboard incorporates key performance indicators (KPIs), geospatial maps, time-series visualizations, and filter-based interactivity to present the progression and severity of the pandemic in an accessible and meaningful way.

The dataset for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, and the entire dashboard — including the visual design, data modeling, and analytical logic — was developed independently by me, with occasional use of AI tools for efficiency and inspiration.

## ✍️ Conclusion

This COVID-19 Power BI dashboard project helped me:

- Apply real-world data storytelling techniques  
- Practice DAX and Power Query transformations  
- Build a well-structured, interactive, and insightful dashboard  

By visualizing key global metrics and time-based trends, this dashboard allows for a deeper understanding of the pandemic’s severity across time and regions.

This project demonstrates how Power BI can be used to create powerful and meaningful narratives through data. I look forward to applying these skills to more real-world datasets in the future!
